# Customer Churn Prediction (Machine Learning)

Objective: Build a churn classification model to predict customer churn and identify key churn drivers.

Files:
- `churn.csv` — synthetic dataset
- `churn.ipynb` — notebook with EDA, modelling and evaluation
- `churn.py` — runnable script to train and save a RandomForest model
- `confusion_matrix.png` — evaluation visualization

How to run:
1. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib joblib`
2. Run `python churn.py` or open `churn.ipynb` in Jupyter.
